      <h1>DISCOUNT EMPORIUM – PROJECT DOCUMENTATION</h1> <br>
       
      <p>
      
       Discount Emporium is a smart and reliable platform designed to help shoppers in Pakistan discover the highest discounts, best prices, and verified deals from multiple brands and online stores — all in one place.

Instead of visiting dozens of websites, users can instantly browse curated promotions, trending offers, hot sales, and budget-friendly products across categories like fashion, accessories, electronics, home items, and more.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Goal</strong>
        <p>
          Provide users with real discounted products from verified brands in
          Pakistan, and redirect them safely to the brand's official website to

    threshold: 0.3,
    });
    results = fuse.search(word).map((r) => r.item);
    });</pre>
